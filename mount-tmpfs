# This script simply mounts a tmpfs filesystem at build/test/cassandra
# If there is already a tmpfs mounted at that location, it will be unmounted first
# The size of the tmpfs is 1GB

# The script is expected to work on both Linux and MacOS

# Run the script from the root of your project. In most cases it should improve performance of running unit tests.
# Do not run it using sudo, it will ask for sudo password if needed.
# The script does not expect any arguments.
