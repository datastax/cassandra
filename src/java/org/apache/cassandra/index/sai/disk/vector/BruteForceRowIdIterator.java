/**
 * An iterator over {@link ScoredRowId} that lazily consumes from a {@link PriorityQueue} of {@link RowWithApproximateScore}.
 * <p>
 * The idea is that we maintain the same level of accuracy as we would get from a graph search, by re-ranking the top `k``
 * best approximate scores at a time with the full resolution vectors to return the top `limit`.
 * <p>
 * For example, suppose that limit=3 and k=5 and we have ten elements.  After our first re-ranking batch, we have
 *   ABDEF?????
 * We will return A, B, and D; if more elements are requested, we will re-rank another 5 (so three more, including
 * the two remaining from the first batch).  Here we uncover C, G, and H, and order them appropriately:
 *      CEFGH??
 * This illustrates that, also like a graph search, we only guarantee ordering of results within a re-ranking batch,
 * not globally.
 * <p>
 * As an implementation detail, we use a PriorityQueue to maintain state rather than a List and sorting.
