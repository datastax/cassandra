/**
 * Wraps one or more writers as output for rewriting one or more readers: every sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb
 * we look in the summary we're collecting for the latest writer for the penultimate key that we know to have been fully
 * flushed to the index file, and then double check that the key is fully present in the flushed data file.
 * Then we move the starts of each reader forwards to that point, replace them in the Tracker, and attach a runnable
 * for on-close (i.e. when all references expire) that drops the page cache prior to that key position
 *
 * hard-links are created for each partially written sstable so that readers opened against them continue to work past
 * the rename of the temporary file, which is deleted once all readers against the hard-link have been closed.
 * If for any reason the writer is rolled over, we immediately rename and fully expose the completed file in the Tracker.
 *
 * On abort we restore the original lower bounds to the existing readers and delete any temporary files we had in progress,
 * but leave any hard-links in place for the readers we opened to cleanup when they're finished as we would had we finished
 * successfully.
