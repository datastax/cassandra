/**
 * Class used to specify the direction of iteration. Provides methods used to replace comparisons and values in typical
 * loops and allow code to be written without explicit direction checks.
 * <p>
 * For example, iterating between l and r inclusive in forward direction is usually done as<br/>
 * {@code for (int i = l; i <= r; ++i) ...}
 * <p>
 * To loop over them in the specified direction dir, the loop above would change to<br/>
 * {@code for (int i = dir.start(l, r); dir.le(i, dir.end(l, r)); i += dir.increase) ...}
