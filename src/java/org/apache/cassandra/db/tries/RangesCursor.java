/// A cursor for a [TrieSet] that represents a set of ranges.
///
/// Ranges in this trie design always include all prefixes and all descendants of the start and end points. That is,
/// the range of ("abc", "afg") includes "a", "ab", "abc", "af, "afg", as well as any string staring with "abc", "ac",
/// "ad", "ae", "afg". The range of ("abc", "abc") includes "a", "ab", "abc" and any string starting with "abc".
///
/// Ranges that contain prefixes (e.g. ("ab", "abc")) are invalid as they cannot be specified without violating order in
/// one of the directions (i.e. "ab" is before "abc" in forward order, but not after it in reverse).
/// The reason for these restrictions is to ensure that all individual ranges are contiguous spans when iterated in
/// forward as well as backward order. This in turn makes it possible to have simple range trie and intersection
/// implementations where the representations of range trie sets do not differ when iterated in the two directions.
///
/// Thes types of ranges are actually preferable to us, because we use prefix-free keys with terminators that leave
/// room for greater- and less-than positions, and at prefix nodes we store metadata applicable to the whole branch.
///
/// The ranges are specified by passing a sequence of boundaries, where each even boundary is the opening boundary, and
/// the odd ones are the closing boundary for a range. The boundaries must be in order and cannot overlap, but it is
/// possible to repeat a boundary, e.g.
/// - `[a, a] == point a`: an even number of repeats starting at an even position specifies a point
///    (i.e. the set of all prefixes and all descendants of that key)
/// - `[a, b, b, c] == [a, c]`: an even number of repeats which starts at an odd position is ignored
/// - `[a, a, a, b] == [a, b]`: an odd number of repeats is the same as a single copy
///
/// If the first boundary is null, the range is open on the left, and if the last non-null boundary is on an even
/// position (i.e. if the array has an even length and its last boundary is null, or if that last boundary is cut off),
/// the range is open on the right:
/// - `[null, a]` covers all keys smaller than `a`, plus the prefixes and descendants of `a`
/// - `[a, null]` or `[a]` covers all keys greater than `a`, plus the prefixes and descendants of `a`
