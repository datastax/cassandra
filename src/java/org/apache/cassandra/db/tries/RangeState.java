/// A range state interface used for range tries.
///
/// This interface combines two logical concepts:
/// - A range marker / boundary point, which is a point in the trie that or starts or ends a range, or switches between
///   ranges. Such markers are the content of a range trie and by themselves are sufficient to define and recreate the
///   trie.
///
///   Markers return `true` for [#isBoundary()] and usually return different values for [#precedingState] in the two
///   directions (which can be `null` if no range applies). It is also possible for a marker to specify a point of
///   coverage, in which the preceding state is the same in both directions.
///
/// - A covering range state, which describes the range that applies to an iteration position which is inside a covered
///   range. These are necessary to be able to efficiently jump inside range tries, for example when constructing the
///   intersection between a range trie and a set trie to answer a query. When a cursor skips over a requested point,
///   the preceding state that the cursor returns is a covering state, which describes the range that applies to (i.e.
///   covers) the position the user requested.
///
///   Covering states return `false` for [#isBoundary()] and must return themselves for [#precedingState] in both
///   directions.
///
/// Using this combination instead of separate concepts simplifies and improves the performance of the implementation.

    /// Returns the state that applies to the positions preceding this marker in the given iteration order, if any.
    ///

    /// preceding states are equal to itself).
