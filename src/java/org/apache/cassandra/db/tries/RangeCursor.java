/// The cursor implementation of [RangeTrie].
///
/// The main difference between normal and range cursors is the addition of a [#precedingState] method, which returns a
/// range for prefixes of start or end positions and is used to determine whether a position that has been skipped to
/// falls inside one the trie's ranges.
///
/// As an example, consider the following range trie:
///
/// ```
/// a ->
///   b -> start of del1              (left: null, right: del1)
/// c ->
///   d -> switch from del1 to del2   (left: del1, right: del2)
///   g ->
///     h -> end,del2                 (left: del2, right: null)
/// ```
///
/// If we advance through this trie, it is easy to keep track of the covering deletion, as we walk through the
/// boundaries before entering the range. However, if we skip into the trie, we will not see the boundaries.
/// Imagine a cursor starts at the root and attempts to skip to "b". We need to be able to notice that "b" is covered by
/// the "ab-cd" range with deletion del1. This is achieved by using [#precedingState]. In this case skipping to "b"
/// (in forward direction) will position the cursor on "c"; because the positions to the left of "c" are covered by
/// del1, the [#precedingState] the cursor should report must be a covering non-boundary state corresponding to `del1`.
///
/// If, on the other hand, we perform a skip in the reverse direction that reaches the same state, the cursor should
/// report `null` as its state (e.g. performing a `skipTo` from the root with character "d" will land in "c" whose state
/// correctly determines that there is no covering deletion for "d").
///
/// For further details, see the range trie section in [Trie.md](./Trie.md).
