/// Deletion-aware trie interface that combines live data and deletion information in a unified structure.
///
/// This class implements the definitions of some simple deletion-aware tries (live singletons, deleted ranges), as
/// well as the main algebraic operations:
/// - intersecting a deletion-aware trie with a set/range, returning only the live paths and content covered by the
///   set, as well as any applicable range restricted to the bounds of the set;
/// - merging deletion-aware tries, applying the deletions of each set to the live data of the others and properly
///   combining the deletion branches of all sources.
///
/// It also provides methods of processing and iterating over the live content of the trie, as well as means
/// of obtaining the full range deletion view of the trie and a combined data-with-deletions view.
///
/// The structure of a deletion-aware trie presents the live data in its normal paths, and deleted ranges
/// in additional "deletion branches". The objective of this split it to be able to separately and efficiently
/// query the two: on one hand, to search for the closest live entry without having to walk paths leading to
/// deleted data, and on the other, to be able to find the covering deletions affecting any position in the
/// trie. With this design, both can be achieved in time proportional to the length of the key.
///
/// For efficiency there can only be at most one deletion branch defined for any path in the trie. I.e. a deletion
/// branch cannot cover another deletion branch. To additionally improve merge performance we also support a mode
/// of operation where it is known that the depth at which a deletion can be introduced is determined in advance for
/// every path for all sources (in other words, that if one source defines a deletion branch at one point, none of the
/// other sources can define a deletion branch below it); this is the mode of operation intended for use in Cassandra
/// memtables and sstables, where deletion branches are defined at the root of each partition.
///
/// This class expects deletions to always be specified as ranges, and the deletion boundaries to never coincide with
/// live keys or their prefixes (this property is provided by the prefix-free [ByteComparable] conversions).
/// While deletion branches can support point deletions, this support is somewhat restricted for efficiency reasons
/// (e.g. the coverage of positions under a point deletion is undefined).
///
/// It is also expected that a deletion-aware trie does not contain any live data that is deleted by its own deletion
/// branches. If such data exists, whether it is preserved after transformations is undefined.
///
/// See [DeletionAwareCursor] for details on cursor operations and [InMemoryDeletionAwareTrie] for the
/// concrete in-memory implementation.
