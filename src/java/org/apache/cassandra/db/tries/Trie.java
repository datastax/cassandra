/// Basic deterministic trie interface.
///
/// Normal users of tries will only use the public methods of [BaseTrie] and this class, which provide various
/// transformations of the trie, conversion of its content to other formats (e.g. iterable of values), and several
/// forms of processing.
///
/// For any unimplemented data extraction operations one can build on the [TrieEntriesWalker] (for-each processing)
/// and [TrieEntriesIterator] (to iterator) base classes, which provide the necessary mechanisms to handle walking
/// the trie.
///
/// The internal representation of tries using this interface is defined in the [Cursor] interface, accessed via the
/// [CursorWalkable] interface's [#cursor] method. [#cursor]/[#makeCursor] is the only method of the interface without
/// an implementation; to define a trie, one needs to implement it. We usually do this by returning a lambda, and Java's
/// single abstract method functionality takes care of adding the trie plumbing around it.
///
/// Cursors are a method of presenting the internal structure of a trie without representing nodes as objects, which is
/// still useful for performing the basic operations on tries (iteration, slicing/intersection and merging). A cursor
/// will list the nodes of a trie in order, together with information about the path that was taken to reach them.
///
/// To begin traversal over a trie, one must retrieve a cursor by calling [#cursor]. Because cursors are
/// stateful, the traversal must always proceed from one thread. Should concurrent reads be required, separate calls to
/// [#cursor] must be made. Any modification that has completed before the construction of a cursor must be
/// visible, but any later concurrent modifications may be presented fully, partially or not at all; this also means that
/// if multiple are made, the cursor may see any part of any subset of them.
///
/// Note: This model only supports depth-first traversals. We do not currently have a need for breadth-first walks.
///
/// See [Trie.md](./Trie.md) for further description of the trie representation model.
