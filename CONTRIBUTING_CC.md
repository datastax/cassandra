# Merging

Feel free to make your contributions: Patches, PRs, diffs,... all welcomed.
- Create a PR against main.
- Ensure all your commits are squashed into 1 or under a sensible grouping. Rebase to account for any changes.
- Follow the checklist in the PR and DoD (Definition of Done). Get your work reviewed and approved.
- Create a PR for main-5.0 and get approval likewise.
- Merge your PR to main: Squash and merge or Rebase and merge can be used.
- Then cherrypick your main-5.0 change into main-5.0.
- IMPORTANT: Do not forward merge main into main-5.0.
